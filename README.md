# bioreactor
A collection of Arduino sketches for sensors, motors, and heating pads as part of a circuit for a stirred-tank bacterial bioreactor.

## Sketches

* `bioreactor_temperature` is a sketch for just a DS18B20 temperature sensor.
* `bioreactor_humidity` is for just a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor module.
* `bioreactor_servo` is for just a high-torque *continuous rotation* servo motor.
* `bioreactor_heating_pad` is for just a heating pad.
* `bioreactor_2` is for the temperature and humidity sensors in one circuit.
* `bioreactor_3` is for the temperature and humidity sensors *and* the servo motor in one circuit.
* `bioreactor_4` is for the temperature and humidity sensors, servo, *and* heating pad in one circuit.
